<h2>Introduction</h2>
The airplane fuel system in a delta-wings airplane such as Concorde has three functions:
<ul></ul>
<li>to supply fuel to the engines,</li>
<li>to control the position of the aircraftʼs Centre of Gravity (CG),</li>
<li>and to act as a heat sink to absorb kinetic heating from the structure and to dissipate heat generated by the air-conditioning and hydraulic systems.</li>
</ul>
<br>
<p>A main job of the fuel system in such a design is transferring fuel across multiple tanks. Here is an explanation of this idea from the Concorde engineers:</p>
<p>“ Before Concorde takes-off, the flight engineer will start to move fuel from the forward trim tanks to the rear trim and collection tanks, this will continue during the acceleration through Mach 1 and onto eventual Mach 2. During this process around 20 tons of fuel is moved and this results in a shift of the CG by 6ft (2meters). This will neatly balance the change in the center lift of the aircraft. ”

<h2>Circular Linked List</h2>
<p>A circular linked list is a linked list in which the last node points to references the first node. To access the linked list we store the memory location for the last node in a pointer reference variable. This pointer reference variable in different applications is referred to by different names such as cursor or current. Generally, the current pointer points reference refers to the latest node inserted into the list. Therefore, the next node of current is the first one inserted into the list. The circular linked list is commonly used to implement the queue ADT in which the dequeue happens at the next node of current.</p>

<h2>Assignment</h2>
<p>Your assignment is to implement a circular linked list data structure that stores the tanks information and provides the required functionality for the system. Since the number of tanks for different airplane designs would be different, using a linked list data structure makes this software module more general.</p>
<p>For this project, you are provided with :</p>
<ul>
<li>skeleton .java file (FuelSys.java)</li>
<li>simple driver (driver.java)</li>
<li>Junit test for the FuelSys class (MyFuelSysTest.java) that you will complete. Test for methods provided are not enough to thoroughly test the method – they are just to get you started.</li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, you are responsible for thoroughly testing your program. Your test program, MyFuelSysTest.java, must be submitted along with other files. For grading purposes, your implementation will be tested on input data of varying sizes and configurations. Your submission will also be checked for memory leaks and memory errors.</p>

<h2>Specifications</h2>
<p>There are three classes in this project. The Tank class is a node in the linked list and it stores the information for a fuel tank. The Pump class is a node in a singly linked list and it stores the information for a pump that is installed in a tank. Every tank may have multiple fuel pumps installed. Every pump can transfer fuel from its parent tank to a specified target tank. The FuelSys class stores the information for the entire fuel system and it implements a circular linked list.</p>
<h2>Class Tank</h2>
<p>The implementation of this class is provided. You are not allowed to modify this class. The Tank class implements a node that can be used in a linked list. Every node has a pointer reference to the next node in the linked list. This pointer reference is stored in the m_next member variable. Every tank object has a unique ID number in this system. Moreover, every tank can have multiple fuel pumps. The pumps of a tank are stored in a singly linked list (not circular) accessible through the head of the list that is stored in the member variable m_pumps. The member variable m_tankFuel stores the current amount of fuel in the tank. We can transfer part of the current fuel to another tank using one of the pumps installed in the tank.</p>
<h2>Class Pump</h2>
<p>The implementation of this class is provided. You are not allowed to modify this class. The Pump class implements a node that can be used in a linked list. Every node has a pointer reference to the next node in the linked list. This pointer reference is stored in the m_next member variable. Every pump object has a unique ID number in the context of its parent tank. Moreover, every pump has a target tank that can receive fuel from the pump. This tank ID is stored in the member variable m_target. </p>
<h2>Class FuelSys</h2>
<p>This class implements a circular linked list data structure. You need to implement the class. The Tank nodes are stored in the linked list which is represented by the pointer reference to its current node stored in the member variable m_current. Every tank has a unique ID number. The list does not hold duplicate tank IDs. The tank IDs are integer numbers greater than or equal to zero.</p>
<table>
    <tr>
<td>FuelSys()</td>
<td>Default constructor creates an empty object and initializesmember variables.</td></tr>
    <tr>
<td>FuelSys(FuelSys rhs)</td>
<td>The copy constructor creates a deep copy of rhs. Reminder: a deep copy means the current object has the same information as rhs object, however, it has its own memory allocated. Note: the new copy is an exact copy of rhs. For example, the pumps of a tank appear in the same order as in rhs.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>~FuelSys()</td>
<td>(Not needed for Java implementation)	Destructor deallocates all memory and reinitializes member
variables.</td></tr><tr>
<td>void advance()</td>
<td>Current location advanced to the next location. Returns true if tank list is not empty, otherwise returns false;</td></tr><tr>
<td>Tank getCurrentTank()</td>
    <td>This function returns the current Tank object within the circular linked list of Tanks.</td></tr><tr>
<td>boolean addTank(int tankID, int tankCap, int tankFuel)</td>	
        <td>This function creates and inserts a new Tank object after the current location of the list and makes the node the current location. If the insertion is successful the function returns true, otherwise it returns false. Since the tank IDs must be unique in the list this function will not insert the tank if it already exists. In such a failure case the function returns false. The tankCap cannot be less than the min capacity. The
amount of fuel cannot exceed the tank capacity. The tankID must be greater than 0.</td></tr><tr>
<td>boolean removeTank(int tankID)</td>	
    <td>This function removes the tank with tankID from the list. If the requested tank is removed the function returns true otherwise it returns false, i.e. if tankID does not exist the function returns false. Note, if the tank has pumps the list of pumps must be removed too. The current location remains unchanged.</td></tr><tr>
<td>boolean findTank(int tankID)</td>	
        <td>This function searches the list for tankID. If the ID is found the function makes the current location the node before the found tankID node and it returns true. If the ID is not found the function returns false.</td></tr><tr>
<td>boolean empty()</td>	
        <td>Checks if the list (of tanks) is empty</td></tr><tr>
<td>boolean addPump(int tankID, int pumpID, int targetTank)</td>	
        <td>This function finds the tankID and adds a pump with pumpID to the tank's pump list. The targetTank is the tank ID that will receive fuel from the parent of the pump in the case of transfer requests. Both tankID and targetID must exist in the list in order to add the pump. In the case of success the function returns true, otherwise it returns false. The pump
must be added to the head of the pump list. The current location remains unchanged.</td></tr><tr>
<td>boolean removePump(int tankID, int pumpID)</td>	
    <td>This function removes the pumpID from the tankID. If the remove operation is successful the function returns true. If either tankID or pumpID does not exist it is a failure and the
function returns false. The current location remains unchanged.</td></tr><tr>
<td>boolean remove()</td>	
    <td>Remove the Tank node after current. If the list is not empty return true, otherwise return false.</td></tr><tr>
<td>boolean fill(int tankID, int fuel)</td>	
        <td>This function fills up the tankID with the amount of fuel. If the empty space of the tank is less than fuel the function still fills up the tank up to its capacity and returns true. If the tank
does not exist the function returns false. The current location remains unchanged.</td></tr><tr>
<td>int totalFuel() const</td>	
    <td>This function calculates and returns the total amount of current fuel in the airplane. The total amount of fuel is the
sum of fuel in all tanks.</td></tr><tr>
<td>boolean drain(int tankID, int pumpID, int fuel)</td>	
    <td>This function transfers the fuel from tankID to the targetID specified in the pumpID. If the amount of requested transfer is more than the current empty space in the target tank, the function fills the target tank and returns true. If the amount of requested transfer is less than the empty space of the target tank the function transfers all and returns true. If the amount of requested transfer is greater than the current fuel in the source tank, the function performs the transfer and makes the source tank empty. In a case of failure that either tank or
the pump does not exist the function returns false. The current location remains unchanged.</td></tr><tr>
<td>String dumpSys() const</td>	
    <td>This function returns the list of tanks along with the amount of current fuel in the tank and the list of its pumps. The implementation of this function is provided for the debugging purposes.</td></tr>

<h2>Additional Requirements</h2><ul>
<li>The class declarations for Tank, Pump and FuelSys and provided function headers in FuelSys.java may not be modified in any way. No additional libraries may be used in the project implementation. Private helper functions may be used in FuelSys.java, but must be declared after: //Any additional private function you need go here</li>
<li>No STL containers or additional libraries may be used except the ones already in the project files. STL containers or additional libraries may be used in your tests, i.e. MyFuelSysTest.java</li>
<li>Follow all coding standards as described on the C++ Coding Standards. In particular, indentations and meaningful comments are important.</li></ul>


<h2>Testing</h2>
<p>You need to test your project and you need to submit your tests along with your project. Tests must be submitted in a file called
MyFuelSysTest.java.</p><ul>
<li>The test file name must be MyFuelSysTest.java.</li>
<li>You are responsible for thoroughly testing your work before submission. The following section presents a non-exhaustive list of tests to perform on your implementation.</li>
<li>Tests cannot be interactive. The test file MyFuelSysTest.java  must compile and run to completion.</li>
<li>The testing guidelines page provides information that helps you to write more effective test cases.</li></ul>
<p>Note: Testing incrementally makes finding bugs easier. Once you finish a function and it is testable, make sure it is working correctly.</p>

<h2>Testing FuelSys class:</h2><ul>
<li>Test whether addTank() works correctly for a normal case, i.e. inserting multiple tanks. We check whether the function returns true for every insertion. And we check whether all nodes are inserted.</li>
<li>Test whether addTank() works correctly for an error case. For example, for the error case of insertion we check that the tank with an ID less than zero is not inserted and the function returns false. Another error case would be inserting a duplicate ID. Test whether removeTank() works correctly for a normal case. Create an object with a decent number of tanks and remove all, then check if all are removed correctly and at every removal the function returns true.</li>
<li>Test whether removeTank() works correctly for an error case which the removal request is for a non-existing tank.</li>
<li>Test whether advance() works correctly for an empty tank list and a non-empty tank list</li>
<li>Test whether findTank() works correctly for a normal case. Create an object with a decent number of tanks and search for them, then check if the found tank is the next node of the current node in the list and at every search operation the function returns true.</li>
<li>Test whether findTank() works correctly for an error case which the tank does not exist in the list. Test whether totalFuel() works correctly for a normal case. It returns the correct value.</li>
<li>Test whether remove() works correctly for an empty list and a non-empty list.</li>
<li>Test whether totalFuel() works correctly for an error case. It returns zero where there is no tank in the system. Test whether addPump() works correctly for a normal case. It adds multiple pumps to some of the tanks.</li>
<li>Test whether addPump() works correctly for an error case. It does not add a duplicate pump ID to a tank. Another error case would be adding a pump to a tank that does not exist.</li>
<li>Test whether removePump() works correctly for a normal case. It removes multiple pumps from some of the tanks.</li>
<li>Test whether removePump() works correctly for an error case. That is trying to remove a non-existent pump or trying to remove a pump from a non-existent tank.</li>
<li>Test whether drain() works correctly. It transfers the fuel from the source tank to the target tank correctly where the requested fuel is less than the empty space of the target tank. Another case would be when the amount of fuel is more than the empty space of the target tank.</li>
<li>Test whether drain() works correctly for the error cases. For example, the source tank or the pump or the destination tank does not exist in the system.</li>
<li>Test whether the fill() works correctly when the empty space in the tank < the fill amount and when the empty space is > the fill amount.</li>
<li></li>Test the copy constructor.</li></ul>

<h2><s>Memory leaks and errors:</s></h2>
<p></p><s>Run your test program in valgrind; check that there are no memory leaks or errors.
Note: If valgrind finds memory errors, compile your code with the -g option to enable debugging support and then re-run valgrind with the -s and --track-origins=yes options. valgrind will show you the lines numbers where the errors are detected and can usually tell you which line is causing the error.</s></p>
<p><s>Never ignore warnings. They are a major source of errors in a program.</s></p>

<h2>What to Submit</h2>
<p>You must submit the following files to the proj1 submit directory:</p><ul>
<li>FuelSys.java</li>
<li>MyFuelSysTest.java </li></ul>


<h2>Grading Rubric</h2><ul>
<li>The following presents a course rubric. It shows how a submitted project might lose points.</li>
<li>Conforming to coding standards make about 10% of the grade.</li>
<li>Correctness and completeness of your test cases (MyFuelSysTest.cpp) make about 15% of the grade.</li>
<li>We have written test cases to test your submission without knowing anything about your code. Therefore, it is extremely important that your submission conforms to the specified requirements. Passing tests make about 75% of the grade.</li>
<li>There is a 5% deduction for every modification that we need to perform to compile and run your work. For example, if we need to rename your file from mySysFuel.java to SysFuel.java  the deduction will be applied.</li>
<li>There must be a reasonable number of commits in your github classroom repository. You can make commits to your local directory as often as you want. You would want to commit to your github classroom repository every time you have developed a new feature, fixed a bug, etc. You should be thinking dozens of commits. If your commit history is not convincing enough to determine that you did the development yourself, you could lose up to 50% of your grade.</li></ul>
